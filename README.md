### Hi there 👋
I'm Logan, and now I decide to change myself and work harder. 
Lately, I have tried some ways to advance my research of the DS theory, which seems useless.
So I turn to code everyday to provoke the interest in Computer Science.
Now I'm finding ways to combine the DQN function and the DS theory, which contains many aspects to apply.
Ok, that's all I want to say now.
好好学习，天天向上！
